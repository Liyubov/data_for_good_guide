# Data for good guide
This repository is dedicated to the follow-up after the workshop with the Royal Society workshop in UK in March 2020. 
https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/data-governance/

## Contributions 
The question is:
“What practical steps can you or your organisation take to help move forward some of the points that have been raised in the discussions?”    

Here I document and visualise concepts of data pre-processing and making data open.
The main idea is also to structure of concise examples of data (e.g. framework support materials for data analysis).

# Steps for sharing and making data open
Some of best practices for documenting and packaging the data were described in https://frictionlessdata.io/ 
The main steps here are: 
1. checking and verifying licences of data 
2. contacting the owners of the data if this is not clear 
3. putting the datasets on servers (here there are many various technical solutions which may be needed)
Some examples of open datasets can be found here https://github.com/datasets/awesome-data

# Steps for working with open data
Sometimes it is not enough to make the data open, while it is also needed to show and demonstrate some the simplest examples of the datasets. Here we can take examples from open health data from Monster mizer project, which CorrelAid Paris has been working on:
