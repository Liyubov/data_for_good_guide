# Data for good guide
This repository is dedicated to the follow-up after the workshop with the Royal Society workshop in UK in March 2020. 
https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/data-governance/

## Contributions 
The question is:
“What practical steps can you or your organisation take to help move forward some of the points that have been raised in the discussions?”    

The answer is:
"To visualise concepts of data pre-processing and data opening, and to send a concise example of data we made (e.g. framework support materials for data analysis)."
