# Data for good guide
This repository is dedicated to the follow-up after the workshop with the Royal Society workshop in UK in March 2020. 
The main point of the discussions are:
1. “What practical steps can you or your organisation take to help move forward some of the points that have been raised in the discussions?”    
2. "To visualise concepts of data pre-processing and data opening, and to send a concise example of data we made (e.g. framework support materials for data analysis)."
